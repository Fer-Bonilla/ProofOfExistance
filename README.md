# ProofOfExistence

## About
This project demonstrates a basic proof of file existence DApp. This application store user's files in IPFS and corresponding file metadata in blockchain. This application allows users to prove existence of some information by showing a time stamped picture/video.

This application retrieves all the previously uploaded files by a user along with time stamped file metadata to allow other people to verify data authenticity.

User can also add new files to IPFS along with existence proof in blockchain by using simple drag and drop feature.
